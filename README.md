The information available about public funding and government agencies is very dense. It could be quite daunting for the average New Yorker to find out whether the issues they care about are receiving funding, or even which organization is responsible for said issues. When someone wants to contact a representative, vote for a candidate, or determine which organization to support, it is critical to have access to digestible information regarding these issues.

transpareNYC takes all the project funding information from the publicly provided API and renders it in a much more digestable format. We hope that by making this information easier to understand, it would give the average NYC resident knowledge about whether the issues they care about are being addressed and which agencies are responsible.

To use transpareNYC:
1. Please click on one of the eight (8) categories at the top of the page. 
    Then select an agency from the dropdown menu to see a list of projects they funded. 
2. If you would like to search by keyword:
    Use the search bar at the top of page to enter a keyword, and click the search button to see the results.
